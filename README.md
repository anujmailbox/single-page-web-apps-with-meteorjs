### Tuts+ Course: Single Page Web Apps with Meteor
#### Instructor: Andrew Burgess

Meteor.js is a relatively new JavaScript framework with a lot of rather interesting twists to it. Full database access on the client? The same code running on both the client and the server? Not typical, right? It’ll get mind-boggling at times, but I think you’ll enjoy getting to know the Meteor framework.
